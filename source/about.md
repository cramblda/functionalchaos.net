Hello, I'm David. I'm a Senior Technology Services Administrator in the
Portland Metro area. I prefer open source platforms and tools, like Linux
and PHP, but I get along with most everything. Additionally, I recently
retired from teaching information technology classes part-time at Mt Hood
Community College in the evenings and on-line.

I enjoy a large variety of outdoor adventures, but my real passion lies with
Alpinism. I live in the heart of the Cascade range and enjoy climbs on all of
the local volcanoes, ice climbing in Bozeman MT and Ouray CO, and have
recently become very interested in the North Cascades, Cody WY, and big ice
in nearby Canada.
