Although I had been climbing on a number of the Cascade Volcanoes for the last
several years, I had avoided Mount Hood. I had never thought too much about
climbing the mountain and I knew my wife was concerned about the accidents that
were commonly reported on the news every few years. As I contemplate my thoughts
now I think I felt hitting altitudes on Mount Adams that were higher than the
Hood, the climb didn't interest me enough to make my wife more uncomfortable.

After a successful summit of Mount Rainier in May of 2016, I started to consider
the idea of climbing Hood. I felt the technical requirements, crevasses danger,
distance, and altitude on Rainier were substantially more then those of Hood and
I was "pretending" that I was "sparing my wife" at that point.
